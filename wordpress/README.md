This is a compose example for running a wordpress unikernel talking to a
MongoDB unikernel.

Note: This is really only for local dev work - you'll want to front-end
or host your WP pkg differently for prod.

```
ops compose up
```

First login to your mysql and create the database. Then you can login to
wordpress and install that.
